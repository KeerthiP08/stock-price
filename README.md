**STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING**    
This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models. The steps involved in the code simulation are outlined below:

**Steps Involved**  
  
**Importing Necessary Libraries:** Start by importing the required libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
Data Acquisition: Obtain the dataset from the Yahoo Finance website or any other reliable source. This dataset should include historical stock prices and related information.   
**Data Pre-processing:** Perform data pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, removing outliers, and formatting the data into the desired structure.   
**Moving Averages Calculation:** Calculate Moving Averages for various time periods (e.g., 44 days, 50 days, 100 days, 150 days). These Moving Averages help in identifying trends and patterns in the stock prices.   
**Visualization:** Plot the Moving Averages along with the close or open price of the stock. Visualization aids in understanding the historical performance of the stock.   
**LSTM Model Creation:** Create an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for predicting stock prices. This model includes training the data on historical stock prices and testing its performance on unseen data.   
**Prediction Plotting:** Plot the predicted and actual values of the stock prices. This step helps in evaluating the accuracy of the LSTM model in predicting future stock prices.    
**Future Price Prediction:** Use the trained LSTM model to predict stock prices for the next few days or months. Plot the predicted prices to visualize the future trend of the stock.
